# Default settings for postsrsd

# Local domain name. 
# Addresses are rewritten to originate from this domain. The default value 
# is taken from `postconf -h mydomain` and probably okay.
#
#SRS_DOMAIN=example.com

# Exclude additional domains.
# You may list domains which shall not be subjected to address rewriting.
# If a domain name starts with a dot, it matches all subdomains, but not
# the domain itself. Separate multiple domains by space or comma.
#
#SRS_EXCLUDE_DOMAINS=.example.com,example.org

# Secret key to sign rewritten addresses.
# When postsrsd is installed for the first time, a random secret is generated
# and stored in /etc/postsrsd.secret. For most installations, that's just fine.
#
#SRS_SECRET=/etc/postsrsd.secret

# Local ports for TCP list.
# These ports are used to bind the TCP list for postfix. If you change
# these, you have to modify the postfix settings accordingly. The ports
# are bound to the loopback interface, and should never be exposed on
# the internet.
#
#SRS_FORWARD_PORT=10001
#SRS_REVERSE_PORT=10002

# Drop root privileges and run as another user after initialization. 
# This is highly recommended as postsrsd handles untrusted input.
#
RUN_AS=nobody
