# Local domain name.
# Addresses are rewritten to originate from this domain. The default value

# Exclude additional domains.
# You may list domains which shall not be subjected to address rewriting.
# If a domain name starts with a dot, it matches all subdomains, but not
# the domain itself. Separate multiple domains by space or comma.

# Secret key to sign rewritten addresses.
# When postsrsd is installed for the first time, a random secret is generated
# and stored in /etc/postsrsd.secret. For most installations, that's just fine.

# wait for the duration of SRS return address validity (21 days) before
# increading this value as well.

# Local ports for TCP list.
