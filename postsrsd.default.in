# Local domain name. 
# Addresses are rewritten to originate from this domain. The default value 
# is taken from `postconf -h mydomain` and probably okay.
#
SRS_DOMAIN=@MYDOMAIN@

# Exclude additional domains.
# You may list domains which shall not be subjected to address rewriting.
# If a domain name starts with a dot, it matches all subdomains, but not
# the domain itself. Separate multiple domains by space or comma.

# Secret key to sign rewritten addresses.
# When postsrsd is installed for the first time, a random secret is generated
# and stored in /etc/postsrsd.secret. For most installations, that's just fine.

# Local ports for TCP list.
# These ports are used to bind the TCP list for postfix. If you change
# these, you have to modify the postfix settings accordingly. The ports
# are bound to the loopback interface, and should never be exposed on
# the internet.

# Change root directory to a safe place before dropping root priviledges.
